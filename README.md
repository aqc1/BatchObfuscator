# BatchObfuscator

`obfuscate.py`: A simple Python script to obfuscate batch commands.
`obfuscate.go`: A Golang alternative (Still being developed...).

1) Run the `obfuscate.py` script, or compile a binary from `obfuscate.go`.

2) Enter in a command to obfuscate

3) The script will generate the obfuscated payload, output the payload (with number of characters), and write the payload to a `payload.bat` file.
